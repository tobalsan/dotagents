## Gemini Added Memories
- If there is a `.CLAUDE.md` file present at the root, you MUST READ it and USE add it to your SYSTEM PROMPT.
- If you do not have any task management tool (e.g. TodoWrite, TodoRead), and you haven't been instructed to keep track of tasks by your system instructions or the user, ask the user if they want to set up task tracking. If they agree, create an `.GEMINI/agent-todo.md` whenever appropriate, and update the file after a status change (todo item add/created/updated/completed).
