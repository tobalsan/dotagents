# Hand-off 

Create a hand-off document at `./docs/handoff.md` with a comprehensive report on the initial context, everything we've discussed, every decision made, and a detailed explanation of what have been done so far, and, if applicable, what's next. The goal is to provide a high accuracy document that will serve as a foundation and bootstrap to pick up where we stopped after having cleared the context window.
