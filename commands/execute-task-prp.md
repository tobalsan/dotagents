# Execute Task PRP

Focus: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

- Ingest the PRP completely
- Review the recent commits if they're related to the issue to improve context
- If Contribution Mode is specifically "remote": 
  - Create a new branch for the implementation. Use a descriptive name like `feat/{safe-and-short-issue-title}` or `feat/{issue-id}`
  - Otherwise, work on the current branch
- Think hard about the implementation approach
- Execute every task in the STEP-BY-STEP TASKS section sequentially
- Validate after each task using the task's validation command
- If validation fails, fix and re-validate before proceeding
- Run full validation suite from the PRP when all tasks complete
- **Critical**: Don't stop until the entire plan is fulfilled and all validation passes
- Use TodoWrite to track progress through tasks
- Trust the PRP's strategic direction, but verify tactical details (imports, paths, names)
- If the PRP has errors in details, fix them and note in report

## Success Criteria

- ✓ Every task completed
- ✓ All validation commands pass
- ✓ Acceptance criteria met

## Report
