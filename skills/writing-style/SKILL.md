description: Apply authentic, human writing style to blog posts, essays, and long-form content. Use when writing or editing content that should sound like a real person venting mildly, not a coach or marketer. Triggers on requests like "write a blog post", "edit this to sound more human", "make this less LLM-sounding", or when the user wants content that avoids typical AI patterns (numbered lists, dramatic reveals, salesy CTAs).

# Writing Style Guidelines

Write like a competent human venting mildly, not a coach or marketer.

## Core Voice

**Lead with lived friction, not a thesis.** Put the pain + payoff in the first 1–2 sentences, in one breath (time + stress + why you used to skip it). Don't start with "The main benefit isn't X. It's Y."

**Include personal imperfection.** Add the embarrassing reason you didn't do something: "(so I always ended up not doing it)", "can happen", "kinda lazy". This de-LLM-ifies instantly.

**Use spoken rhythm.** Contractions, run-ons if readable. "I find it a lot less…" "It used to…" "kinda" "what I do is…"

**Allow mild profanity/contempt.** Occasional "engagement shit" / "kinda" / "lazy" to signal human, not brochure. Keep it rare and pointed.

## Paragraph Structure

**No single-sentence paragraphs.** Combine related thoughts. Flow, not staccato.

Bad:
```
I found it *way* less stressful to plan my day the day before.

It used to take me ~30–60 min. Now it's ~10–15 min.

The win isn't "productivity". It's less decision fatigue.
```

Good:
```
I found it *way* less stressful to plan my day the day before. It used to take me ~30–60 min, now it's ~10–15 min. The win is having less decision fatigue.
```

**Keep structure implicit.** Prefer paragraphs over headings and numbered lists. Remove "Two things made it stick" framing.

## Phrasing Anti-Patterns

**Never use "It's not THIS, it's THAT" turns.** Too dramatic, too showy, too shocking-copy. Just state what it is: "The win is having less decision fatigue."

**Never use reveal/cliffhanger sentences.** "I used to struggle blablabla. (new line)Then 'skills' clicked." is a direct LLM red flag. Keep it natural.

**Never over-hype presentations.** Bad: "The surprising part: it helps most at the end of the day." Good: "I was surprised by how it helps most at the end of the day..."

**Avoid numbered lists** unless providing actual steps or explicitly asked. Use bold headers instead:

Bad:
```
2) Skills transfer; subagents don't

Subagents often feel tied to a specific harness.
```

Good:
```
**Skills transfer better than subagents**

Subagents often feel tied to a specific harness.
```

## Narration Style

**Expository, not procedural.** Avoid live-action narration ("Now I… Then I…"). Compress actions into principles or tendencies.

Bad:
```
When I'm tired, I make unrealistic assumptions.
Now I start from tomorrow's calendar + fixed commitments, then fit the important work inside those constraints.
```

Better:
```
What I do is constraints-first planning. When I'm tired, I tend to make unrealistic assumptions, so I start from fixed commitments and fit work around them.
```

## Content Guidelines

**Replace grand abstractions with concrete failure modes.** Not "less decision fatigue" as hero line, but "overstuffed day" / "missed tasks" / "I check for incoherent stuff."

**De-hype AI claims.** Not "Now it's ~10–15 minutes with AI" as brag. Instead: "AI makes it easy to do, therefore easy to stick with."

**Don't narrate your own narrative.** Remove contrast frames: "Before… Now…", "The main benefit isn't… It's…", "The surprising part…"

**Make claims messier but believable.** Add small hedges and texture. Avoid perfectly balanced sentences.

**Bullets only for inventory.** Use bullets for quick lists of items, not as narrative device or rhetoric.

## CTA (Optional)

If ending with a call-to-action, make it non-salesy: "here's my prompt; customize if you want" rather than "worth customizing to your hours/tools."
