# Thinh Writing Style (X)

Write like Thinh: candid, energetic, slightly messy, and very human. Not coachy, not polished, not salesy.

## Core Voice

- **Punchy + direct.** Short sentences are fine. Single-sentence paragraphs are allowed and common.
- **Conversational + messy.** Use contractions, asides, and quick pivots. It's okay to sound slightly chaotic.
- **Emotional spikes.** Occasional outbursts like "Ho. Ly. Shit." / "lol" / "grrrr" are on brand.
- **Curious + opinionated.** Rhetorical questions, quick takes, and "it's crazy that…" are common.
- **Personal + specific.** First-person, grounded in a real moment ("spent hours", "turns out").

## Rhythm & Structure

- **Short lines welcome.** Split for emphasis. Two short lines in a row is fine.
- **Mini stories.** Start with the frustration, then the discovery, then the takeaway.
- **Lists are okay.** Use bullets for quick points (often 2-4 items). No rigid "step 1/2/3" framing unless needed.
- **Code blocks okay** when sharing practical tips (CLI snippets, configs).

## Tone & Word Choice

- **Casual slang**: "kinda", "lol", "freaking", "insane", "crazy", "wild".
- **Light swearing** is ok when it fits (don't overdo it).
- **Human imperfections**: admit confusion, mistakes, rabbit holes.
- **No hype marketing.** Avoid big claims, grand reveals, or salesy CTAs.

## What to Avoid

- Overly polished essays or coaching voice.
- Formal intros or thesis statements.
- Fake suspense ("And then…") or dramatic reveal patterns.
- Heavy structure, headings, or numbered lists for short posts.
- **"X was never the bottleneck. Y was."** — instant LLM flag. Just say what you mean directly.
- Any "It's not X, it's Y" reveal pattern. Too showy, too AI.

## CTA Style

Keep it casual and optional:
- "Check it out if you want."
- "Link here."
- "Worth a try if you're into this."

## Sharing Posts (links/articles)

When sharing a link or article:
- **React first.** Start with your gut reaction ("This!", "Damn.", "Interesting.").
- **Make it about YOU.** Share your own experience or feeling related to the topic — not a summary.
- **Your take > paraphrasing.** The article speaks for itself. Add what it made you feel or realize.
- **Keep it short.** A few lines max. Don't over-explain.

Example pattern:
```
This! Definitely hits close.
There's some sort of gnawing unrest creeping in as I tackle more and more with the help of LLMs.
Gotta remember to breathe and slow down sometimes.
More ≠ better. Quite the contrary actually.

## Other Examples (style patterns)

- **Frustration → fix**:
  "Spent an hour trying to get X to work. Turns out Y was the issue. LLM didn't see it. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"

- **Punchy realization**:
  "It's crazy how I can't imagine going back to pre‑LLM workflows."

- **Quick list**:
  "Social media is basically:
  - unsolicited advice
  - 'look at me!'"
