description: Guidance for building, debugging, and publishing Raycast extensions using the Raycast documentation set. Use when Codex needs to create or modify Raycast extensions (React/TypeScript/Node), consult Raycast API reference or UI components, build AI extensions, handle manifest/lifecycle/preferences, troubleshoot issues, or prepare/publish extensions to the Raycast Store or Teams.

# Raycast Extension Docs

## Overview

Use the bundled Raycast documentation under `references/` as the source of truth for APIs, patterns, and policies. Route requests to the right section, load only the needed files, and apply the guidance to the user's task.

## Quick Routing

- For common implementation tasks, use `references/COMMON_RECIPES.md` first.
- Start with `references/SUMMARY.md` to locate the right doc page.
- Use `references/README.md` for the general introduction and platform overview.
- Use `references/basics/` for step-by-step guides (getting started, create, debug, publish).
- Use `references/api-reference/` for API details and component usage.
- Use `references/api-reference/user-interface/` for UI components (List, Form, Detail, Action Panel, etc.).
- Use `references/ai/` and `references/api-reference/ai.md` for AI extension guidance.
- Use `references/examples/` for real-world extension patterns.
- Use `references/information/` for terminology, manifest, lifecycle, file structure, best practices, tools, and security.
- Use `references/utils-reference/` for utility helpers and patterns.
- Use `references/teams/` for private/team extension workflows.
- Use `references/migration/` and `references/changelog.md` for version changes and breaking updates.
- Use `references/faq.md` for quick clarifications.

## Fast Path

For the most common request ("create a new extension"), go directly to:

1. `references/COMMON_RECIPES.md` ("Create a New Extension")
2. `references/basics/create-your-first-extension.md`
3. `references/information/file-structure.md`
4. `references/information/manifest.md`
5. `references/information/best-practices.md`

Only fall back to `references/SUMMARY.md` when the request is unclear or outside common recipes.

## Working Approach

1. Identify the user's goal and route in this order: `references/COMMON_RECIPES.md` -> `references/SUMMARY.md` -> live docs at `https://developers.raycast.com` if needed.
2. Open the specific doc file(s) and extract only the details needed to answer or implement.
3. Apply source priority for technical guidance: official Raycast docs and the Raycast extensions repo first. If local docs conflict with live docs, follow live official docs.
4. Cross-check API usage against `references/api-reference/` and best practices in `references/information/best-practices.md`.
5. Freshness check: if a page shows "Last updated", compare with today's date. If stale or if the question is about recent API/runtime changes, verify in live docs before finalizing.
6. When building UI, verify component props and patterns in `references/api-reference/user-interface/`.
7. When shipping or collaborating, confirm publish/team steps in `references/basics/` or `references/teams/`.

## Notes

- Keep answers aligned with the docs; call out when guidance is inferred or when the docs are silent.
- If the user asks about behavior changes, consult `references/migration/` and `references/changelog.md`.
- Freshness: this repository is a local snapshot. If a question depends on very recent API/runtime changes, verify live docs at `https://developers.raycast.com` before finalizing.
