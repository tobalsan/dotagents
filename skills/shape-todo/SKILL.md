# Shape Todo

Your task is to first help me flesh out the detailed specs for the task described in $ARGUMENTS.

We're going to use a sequential interviewing process described next to help:
- clarify the details, 
- identify blockers or unresolved decisions,
- determine owner (Thinh, one of the agents of the AI company: Iris, Cody, Cam, Pom, Sextus, Cloud)
- schedule the execution,
- then write the specs. 

## Sequential interviewing process

TODO items are often a one-sentence high-level description. You will be interviewing me to clarify the intent, gather requirements, surface potential unresolved decisions or dependencies, and details about the implementation, concerns, tradeoffs, etc.

Make sure questions are not obvious and probe deeper into the underlying needs and constraints.

The process must be sequential, i.e. one question at a time, and not jumping to the next question without answering the previous one.

Interview me continually and systematically until all the details are known and everything is crystal clear. Document all responses and insights to create a comprehensive and well-structured specification that serves as the foundation for the issue specs.
